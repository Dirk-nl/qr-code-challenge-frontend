## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
.container {
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: #D9DBF1
}
```

I learned about using an container in order to align the items to my liking

### Continued development

In further projects, I will keep working on the flexibility of screen height and width.
